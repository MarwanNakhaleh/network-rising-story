<!-- TODO: Revise the discussion so that Richard gets laid off at Dover Consulting before this. I initially wrote this thinking it would happen before what is now chapter 2. His license has not yet been suspended, as far as he's aware. -->

# 3. Curiosity
*April 2, 2024 — Westerville, Ohio, United States - Rusty Bucket Restaurant and Tavern*

"Welcome to Rusty Bucket, boys. My name is Cynthia and I'll be taking care of y'all this evening. What would you like to start off drinking?" The waitress turned and looked at Yuri. 

"Can I start with a Corona?"

"Sure, sweetie. What about you, hon'?" Cynthia then turned to Eaton. 

"I'll have a Bud Light."

"You've got it." The waitress then turned to Richard, who was preoccupied playing Crypt of the Necrodancer on his phone. "Do you want anything to drink, hon'?"

Richard didn't budge. After several seconds, Yuri knocked on Richard's head.

"Hey Dick, she's talking to you."

Richard looked up from his phone. "Oh shit." He turned to look at the waitress. "Can I get a Blue Moon please?"

"You got it, I'll be right back with your drinks, fellas." The waitress walked off to a nearby table.

Yuri furrowed his brow. "What are you all up in your head about now, Dick?"

Richard looked for a second at Yuri and Eaton. They have been going out together to different bars around town to chill and drink almost every Tuesday evening for the past three years, ever since they became friends when working together at Volvo. Richard had left about nine months prior to lay low at Dover Consulting, but he continued to hang out with Yuri and Eaton as they stayed at Volvo. These guys were his compadres, his bois, his homies. 

"Guys, I fucking got laid off. Benjamin was like \"Blue Cross Blue Shield changed their budget, so hit the road, chucklefuck.\" The motherfucker claimed he couldn't place me on another project either."

Eaton gathered his thoughts for a moment. "Damn buddy, let me get this straight. You got bent over by Ben Dover?" Both Eaton and Yuri started cackling like banshees. Richard started to chuckle too after a couple of seconds. "Yeah, I fuckin' guess I did, didn't I?"

"The powers that be love to slap us around, huh," Eaton groaned. "I know Benny's a small guy next to the globalist elite but that's straight up horseshit."

"Yeah they fuckin' do. Maybe I should try to go back to remote work and get a little bungalow in Las Tarrenas. Fuck this bitch ass place."

"You're just bullshittin'." Yuri had to chime in with his opinion. "You've been saying that since you left Volvo. You could do it tomorrow if you wanted, Dickman, and you know it."

The gang fell into silence for a few moments. Curiously, CNBC was airing on the TV in front of the gang's table. A newscaster was interviewing some guy from some company called MicroStrategi about Bitcoin.

"Bitcoin is at least digital gold. It's gonna eat gold. It's got all of the great attributes of gold and none of the defects of gold..." the interviewee droned on like this.

Yuri groaned again. "You know, I bought ten Bitcoins for $250 each when I was in college. It fuckin' dropped to $140 a month later so I punked out and sold. That's like seven hundred G's now!" He let out an exasperated sigh after that mouthful of words. "Motherfucker."

Richard re-opened the game on his phone while Eaton put his hand on Yuri's shoulder. "It's for the best, bud. Bitcoin is like Zion from The Matrix —- it's just a trap for the smarter NPCs." He eased back as he spotted the waitress walking briskly towards the table with the trio's drinks. 

"Here are your drinks, boys." The waitress settled each of the gang's beer glasses in front of them. Richard once again snapped out of his gaming stupor when he noticed the aroma of hops at the table. 

"Thank you, ma'am."

Eaton picked up his glass. "The globalists are gonna take over Bitcoin like they took over the internet and our government. Yeah the number goes up, so what? Fiat money is worthless anyway, it all goes to zero. Just buy guns, ammo, gold, sliver, and supplies. That way, when the Happening happens and you can't access your Bitcoins without internet, you're not completely fucked."

Yuri slumped in his seat. "I guess I'm just gonna have to work until I die like everyone else."

Eaton smiled. "Don't worry buddy, the Happening will eliminate your job and you'll truly be free from this system before you die. Now, you might not have a whole lot of time for that, but you won't have to keep working!" Eaton burst out laughing Richard giggled at the idea of Yuri celebrating not having to work in the event society collapses. 

As Eaton and Yuri continued talking, Richard shifted his attention between the CNBC interview playing on the TV and the homies' chatter. *Clearly motherfuckers are still making lots of money in crypto, otherwise they'd have just stopped talking about it forever ago, right?*
