# 3. Descent

"Richard, Blue Cross Blue Shield abruptly changed their budget and they decided they no longer have a need for your project. At this time, we don't have enough wiggle room in the budgets provided to us for the other projects to shift you elsewhere."

Richard sat expressionless in the chair facing his boss' desk. He knew what was coming, given the introduction provided to him. 

"We're gonna have to furlough you."

Richard continued to sit across the desk from his boss Haywood in silence for several seconds. Suddenly, he looks straight up at the ceiling. 

"Are you okay, Richard?" 

"Yeah, I'm all good. I'm just contemplating life and wondering why God has forsaken me like this."

* Richard gets laid off without notice

* He gets another mail piece the next day from the IRS about his overdue taxes from his contracting work
