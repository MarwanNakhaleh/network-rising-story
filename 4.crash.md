***Work in progress***

*April 2, 2024 — Dublin, Ohio, United States - Exit 17A on Interstate 270 westbound*

*Richard gets into a car accident and he's taken to the hospital. He's not too badly injured, but of course the hospital is going to hit him with an enormous bill for which he doesn't have insurance since his employer laid him off. He also learns that he was driving on a suspended license because the ticket he received in Chapter 1 was registered in the system even though the printer did not work.*

# 4. Crash

Richard eased his foot off the gas and signaled to turn as he approached the highway exit to take him home. Despite the alcohol he enjoyed with his bois earlier, the glow of the setting sun gave him a rush of excitement by remindin him of the mamajuana he was going to knock back when he got home. The old merengue music was cranked up even louder than usual to compensate for his temporarily dulled senses.

"Y es que eres demasiado niña, para empezar a amar. Eres como una fruta nueva, que no se debe tumbar!" Richard sang his heart out, the alcohol amplifying the passion in his voice. 

Richard barely registered a view in the mirror of a car speeding diagonally from behind him. The dumbass had swerved all the way from the leftmost lane to the exit, seemingly unable to calculate in time a simple decision of when to move towards the exit lane. Suddenly, Richard noticed a sharp force pushing the rear left corner of his car. The other guy had clipped the edge of Richard's car in a rush to reach the exit, causing him to completely lose control of the vehicle in an instant. 

Richard's car spun in a full circle and then slammed into the metal guardrail with a deafening crunch. The impact rattled through his body as glass shattered and the world around him started to detach from reality. 

The rusty Impala collided with the guardrail with such force that it vaulted over the thin steel layer, flipped upside down, and tumbled into the grass media. Richard was still so numbed and confused by the sudden turn of events that even as he sat upside down in the totaled vehicle, he could not bring himself to react to the unfolding calamity. 

*What the hell just happened? Am I dreaming?*

The next thing Richard became aware of was the sound of muffled voices. Gradually, they grew clearer: “Sir, can you hear me? Stay with us.” His eyelids fluttered open, and a pair of concerned EMTs loomed above him, their hands moving efficiently as they checked his vitals. He tried to speak, but his mouth felt dry, and his head throbbed with a dull, relentless ache. One of the EMTs offered a reassuring smile. “You’re going to be okay. You’ve been in an accident, but we’re taking care of you.”

They gently lifted him onto a stretcher, strapping him in securely before wheeling him to the waiting ambulance. Richard’s surroundings swayed as the stretcher rolled, and the flashing red and blue lights reflected off the ambulance’s polished surface. He caught glimpses of twisted metal and shards of glass littering the roadway before the doors swung shut. 

Inside the ambulance, the steady beeping of monitors mixed with the hum of the engine. “Your arm’s broken, and it looks like you have a concussion,” one of the EMTs said, her voice calm but professional. “We’re taking you to the hospital to get checked out.” Richard nodded weakly, his mind still catching up with what had happened. Pain radiated from his left arm, but a sense of relief washed over him. He was alive, and for now, that was enough. -->
