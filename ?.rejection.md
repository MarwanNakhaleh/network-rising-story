*Richard excitedly tells the homeboys about the network state and its potential, but they think he's getting in over his head and they try to dissuade him.*

***Work in progress***

# ? - Rejection

Cynthia started to walk away after presenting the gang with their fourth round of beer. Eaton sighed heavily at Richard. 

"Buddy, you ain't got a lick of sense. There are only three ways to overcome this globohomo world. Either you die, you wait for the Happening, or you get your God damn guns and wage war to take your fucking rights back. There's no way an \"online community\" of script kiddie crypto nerds can hack into the complicated ass world military systems that have their own communication protocols. They're not gonna do shit, other than maybe scam some idiots."

Richard tried to pull a fast one. "The thing is, there won't be any benefit to the governments of the world to use their militaries to coerce motherfuckers if the wealth is locked behind cryptographically impenetrable private keys!"

"You'll gladly sing your passphrase when they break your kneecaps."

Yuri butted in as well. "Besides, all of that is \"too good to be true\" bullshit. Who the fuck is stupid enough to immigrate to some island in fuckin' Honduras because some snake oil salesmen tell them they can live forever?"  

"Well, you don't have to immigrate there, you can just get the gene therapy."

Eaton fumed. "Gene therapy?! And have the New World Order inject their bullshit into your body?! You're out of your God damn mind!"

"Guys, do you really want the centralized powers to consolidate their grasp on the world? They absolutely will unless we can build these decentralized parallel power structures."

"HELL no we don't, but they're too powerful now. When their \"great reset\" causes the Happening, we can pick up the pieces afterwards."

"You know that's how the Viet Cong successfully deterred the powerful centralized ass US forces in Vietnam - as a decentralized network with a shared ideological North Star! They didn't have the manpower or the training the US forces did, but they knew their own shit they all had a common goal."
