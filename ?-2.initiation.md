***Work in progress***

*Mike Ropini invites Richard out to Dallas to discuss more network ideas and "collaborate". Richard interprets this as Mike offering him a job so he gets his ass on that plane and heads to Dallas. Mike welcomes Richard to the office, introduces him to his lead engineer The Dragon King, and he gives a brief overview of his company and ideas.*

"Long, this is Richard. He's my lead engineer." Mike called out to a mousey-looking Asian guy with long hair. The guy was poring over code on a giant curved monitor.

Upon registering that his boss was interrupting him, Long facepalmed at his desk. With an exasperated sigh, he stood up and turned towards Richard and Mike. *Always with the interruptions. Don't you see I'm busy?!* He walked hurriedly towards the pair and then stood still.

Richard extended his right hand to shake. "Nice to meet you, Long."

"Same. I go by The Dragon King."

"It's cool, Dragon King, I was getting ready to explain that to Richard."

Long then turned to Mike with a quizzical look on his face. "What's he doing here exactly?" He motioned at Richard.

"Well, depending on how the next few hours goes, you might have to come up with an answer to that question for us in the near future."

"I see."
