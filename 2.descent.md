# 2. Descent
*March 28, 2024 - Columbus, Ohio, United States - Dover Consulting*

*Thank fucking God, it's almost 5 o'clock, then tomorrow is personal project day. I need to add OAuth to my Facebook for Dogs app.* 

Richard chilled in an oversized brown beanbag chair at Dover Consulting's office as he added the finishing touches a documentation write-up for the client company's prior authorization app's SSO implementation he finished building. 

The office actually had a very comfortable atmosphere, at least on its surface. There were a few standard desks and monitors available for employees coming into the office -- nothing very fancy, but not bottom-shelf materials either. Dover Consulting also had four tiny private rooms for employees to take client calls without disrupting others. In a large open space area, several enormous beanbag chairs rested on the floor. Benjamin, Richard's boss and the owner of the company, even allowed his developers to bring blankets to make the beanbag chair programming even cozier. And of course the office had a full kitchen fully stocked with the employees' favorite snacks and coffee. Benjamin even allowed a full workday every two weeks for his engineers to work on personal projects and explore cool new technologies outside of the confines of the job duties. This condition was met no matter what deadlines the client had.

As comfortable as this work environment may sound to some people, Benjamin does not provide these niceties out of the goodness of his heart. He calculated that his employees would perform better overall and more than pay back two or three days a month of "lost productivity" if given ample breathing room to explore new ways of doing things. He calculated savings on lunchtime breaks with provisions of snacks for everyone. He calculated that the employees would work longer and harder if they were able to work very comfortably, and ultimately he charge the client companies more money. Richard had picked up on Benjamin's game, but he appreciated the change of environment from his previous employer Volvo. 

"Richard, can you come into my office?" Benjamin poked his head around the corner of the beanbag room.

"Sure Benjamin, one moment as I finish this last item." Richard finished typing the last sentence describing to the client's in-house developers how to integrate the system into their other applications. He then closed his laptop and stood up to walk with Benjamin to his office.

Benjamin walked in first to sit down in his Herman Miller office chair behind the large L-shaped desk facing the door. He then motioned to Richard and then to the two basic Walmart-tier chairs in front of the desk, "please have a seat." 

"Richard, Blue Cross Blue Shield abruptly changed their budget and they decided they no longer have a need for your project. At this time, we don't have enough wiggle room in the budgets provided to us for the other projects to shift you elsewhere." Benjamin paused for a moment.

Richard sat expressionless in the chair facing his boss. With an introduction like that, he could surmise the next statement. 

"We're gonna have to furlough you."

Richard sat in silence for several seconds. Suddenly, he looked straight up at the ceiling. 

"Are you okay, Richard?" 

"Yeah, I'm hanging in there. I'm just contemplating life and wondering why God has forsaken me like this."

"I'm really sorry this had to happen, Richard." Benjamin's tone remained unchanged throughout the conversation. 

"How much longer do I have my health insurance?" Richard knew that there was no hope of a monetary severance package between the miniscule size of the company and Benjamin's tight pursestrings.

"We have to stop paying into that immediately, unfortunately." 

Richard ever so slightly pursed his lips, struggling to conceal his anger. *You don't HAVE to stop immediately, you cheap bastard.*

"Are you aware of COBRA? It allows you to keep paying your group rate with your health insurance after you no longer work your job. You're welcome to keep your insurance if you want to pay."

"I'll keep that in mind," Richard uttered almost inaudibly.

"Thanks for being calm and understanding. It's never a fun experience, not for either of us."

Richard let out an exasperated sigh and hauled his already aching ass out of the bargain bin chair. "Well then, I shall bid you adieu, Ben." He started to open the door.

"Do not call me Ben. My name is Benjamin."

Richard suddenly looked back and shot Benjamin a nasty grimace. "Are you gonna fire me for that offense?"

"Get out of my office."
