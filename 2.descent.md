*March 28, 2024 - Columbus, Ohio, United States - Branson Consulting*

*Thank fucking God, it's almost 5 o'clock, then tomorrow is personal project day. I need to add OAuth to my Facebook for Dogs app.* Richard chilled in the largest beanbag chair at Branson Consulting's office as he added the finishing touches a documentation writeup for the new SSO implementation he finished building for the client company's new prior authorization app. 

Working at a software development consulting shop, the pace of work depends heavily on the assigned client's needs, but Richard's boss Benjamin, who also runs the company, steadfastly continued to allow a full workday every two weeks for his engineers to work on personal projects and explore cool new technologies outside of the confines of the job duties.

"Richard, can you come into my office?" Benjamin poked his head around the corner of the beanbag room.

"Sure Benjamin, one moment as I finish this last item." Richard finished typing the last sentence describing to the client's in-house developers how to integrate the system into their other applications. He then closed his laptop and stood up to walk with Benjamin to his office.



"Richard, Blue Cross Blue Shield abruptly changed their budget and they decided they no longer have a need for your project. At this time, we don't have enough wiggle room in the budgets provided to us for the other projects to shift you elsewhere."

Richard sat expressionless in the chair facing his boss' desk. He knew what was coming, given the introduction provided to him. 

"We're gonna have to furlough you."

Richard continued to sit across the desk from his boss Haywood in silence for several seconds. Suddenly, he looks straight up at the ceiling. 

"Are you okay, Richard?" 

"Yeah, I'm all good. I'm just contemplating life and wondering why God has forsaken me like this."

* Richard gets laid off without notice
* Richard gets a piece of mail saying his driver's license is suspended due to nonpayment of a ticket
* He gets another mail piece the next day from the IRS about his overdue taxes from his contracting work
* Richard swears to make enough money that he'll never have to worry about it again
