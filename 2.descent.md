*March 28, 2024 - 4:51 PM - Columbus, Ohio, United States - Dover Consulting*

*Thank fucking God, it's almost 5 o'clock, then tomorrow is personal project day. I need to add OAuth to my Facebook for Dogs app.* 

Richard chilled in an oversized brown beanbag chair at Dover Consulting's office as he added the finishing touches a documentation write-up for the client company's prior authorization app's SSO implementation he finished building. Today, since there was no need to go to a client site, Richard was wearing a pair of red athletic shorts and a grey t-shirt with the Amazon Web Services logo emblazoned on the chest. A half-eaten bag of peanut M&Ms and a lime LaCroix rested at his right side next to the beanbag chair.

The office actually had a very comfortable atmosphere, at least on its surface. There were a few standard desks and monitors available for employees coming into the office -- nothing very fancy, but not bottom-shelf materials either. Dover Consulting also had four tiny private rooms for employees to take client calls without disrupting others. In a large open space area, several enormous beanbag chairs rested on the floor, including the brown one Richard often liked to use. Benjamin, Richard's boss and the owner of the company, even allowed his developers to bring blankets to make the beanbag chair programming even cozier. And of course the office had a full kitchen fully stocked with the employees' favorite snacks and coffee. Benjamin even allowed a full workday every two weeks for his engineers to work on personal projects and tinker with cool new technologies outside of the confines of the job duties. He always saw to it that the engineers had this time no matter what deadlines the client had. 

Benjamin was a fucking machine. He was somehow one of the rare people who could reliably and accurately estimate how much manpower a project would take to complete, able to very quickly gather accurate requirements, determine a direction to go given the constraints, and mentally break down a project into its constituent step-by-step tasks while taking into account his engineers' skill levels and output. He would then stretch the timeline to build in enough room for his engineers to take it relatively easy while he raked in more cash on a longer timeframe. 

Benjamin liked to think it was a win-win situation. There wasn't much room for his engineers to grow in their careers within the company, but he specifically hired for smart developers who had simply decided they were done with the day-to-day stress of corporate and wanted a more relaxed work environment.

As comfortable as such a workplace may sound to some people, Benjamin did not provide these niceties out of the goodness of his heart. He calculated that his employees would perform better overall and more than pay back two or three days a month of "lost productivity" if given ample breathing room to explore new ways of doing things. He calculated savings on lunchtime breaks with provisions of snacks for everyone. He calculated that the employees would work longer and harder if they were able to work very comfortably, and ultimately that will allow him to charge the client companies more money. Richard had picked up on Benjamin's ulterior motive, but he appreciated the change of pace from his previous employer Volvo. 

"Richard, can you come into my office?" Benjamin poked his head around the corner of the beanbag room.

"Sure Benjamin, one moment as I finish this last item." Richard finished typing the last sentence describing to the client's in-house developers how to integrate the system into their other applications. He then closed his laptop, adjusted his sunglasses, and stood up to walk with Benjamin to his office.

Benjamin walked in first to sit down in his Herman Miller office chair behind the large Herman Miller L-shaped desk facing the door. He then motioned to Richard and then to the two basic Walmart-tier chairs in front of the desk, "please have a seat." 

Benjamin let out a pained sigh. He had rehearsed this discussion last night a few times and he recognized he needed to display some emotion. "Richard, UnitedHealthcare abruptly changed their budget and they decided they no longer have a need for your project. At this time, we don't have enough wiggle room in the budgets provided to us for the other projects to shift you elsewhere." He then paused for a moment, just as he had prepared. He allowed Richard a moment to put two and two together.

Richard sat expressionless in the chair facing his boss. With an introduction like that, he could surmise the next statement. 

"We have to furlough you."

Richard sat in silence for several seconds. Suddenly, he looked straight up at the ceiling. 

The sudden movement startled Benjamin for a moment, but he feigned concern nonetheless. "Are you okay, Richard?" 

Richard kept his head turned up at the ceiling as he spoke. "Yeah, I'm hanging in there. I'm just contemplating life and wondering why God has forsaken me like this." He then let his head down and returned his gaze to Benjamin.

"I'm really sorry this had to happen, Richard." Benjamin's tone remained as neutral as it had started. 

"How much longer do I have my health insurance?" Richard knew that there was no hope of a monetary severance package between the miniscule size of the company and Benjamin's tight pursestrings.

"We have to stop paying into that immediately, unfortunately." 

Richard ever so slightly pursed his lips, struggling to conceal his anger. *You don't HAVE to stop immediately, you cheap bastard.*

Benjamin audibly lightened his tone of voice. "Are you aware of COBRA? It allows you to keep paying your group rate with your health insurance after you no longer work your job. You're welcome to keep your insurance if you want to pay."

"I'll keep that in mind," Richard uttered almost inaudibly.

"Thanks for being calm and understanding. It's never a fun experience, not for either of us."

Richard let out an exasperated sigh and hauled his already aching ass out of the bargain bin chair. "Well then, I shall bid you adieu, Ben." He started to open the door.

Benjamin suddenly lost his composure at Richard's transgression. "Do not call me Ben," he angrily retorted. "My name is Benjamin."

Richard suddenly looked back and shot Benjamin a nasty grimace. "Are you gonna fire me for that offense?"

Benjamin turned up his nose and thrust his index finger in the direction of the door. "Get out of my office."
