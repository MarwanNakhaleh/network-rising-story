# Network Rising: The Birth of a New Nation
Richard Cabeza's life has been completely thrown into a tailspin by his employer, his bank, and his country's laws. Feeling completely shafted by the existing establishments, he sets out to minimize their effects on his life by using cryptocurrency. While studying and investing, he stumbles upon a groundbreaking paradigm for using modern technology to build new kinds of communities, cultures, and countries. His frustration and those of the people he meets along his journey spur him forward to implement a network state. 

Throughout his journey, he learns from and works with technological accelerationists, merito-capitalists, and grassroots leaders to create the building blocks for a new nation where no one entity can sieze unchecked power. His traction and influence eventualy raise the ire of intelligence agencies, stodgy regulators, and heads of states who will seek to undermine Richard's progress through all sorts of covert tactics.
