# Network Rising: The Birth of a New Nation
Mistakes and arbitrary decisions from his employer, his bank, and his country have thrown Richard Cabeza's life into a tailspin. Feeling completely shafted by the existing establishments, he starts learning about blockchain in order to take private decentralized custody of his assets. While studying and investing, he stumbles upon a groundbreaking paradigm for using modern technology to build new kinds of communities, cultures, and countries. His frustration and those of the people he meets along his journey spur him forward to implement a network state. 

Throughout his journey, he learns from and works with technological accelerationists, merito-capitalists, and grassroots leaders to create the building blocks for a new nation where no one entity can sieze unchecked power. His traction and influence eventualy raise the ire of intelligence agencies, stodgy regulators, and heads of states who will seek to halt Richard's progress through devious and questionable covert tactics.
