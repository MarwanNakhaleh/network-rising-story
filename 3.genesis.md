<!-- TODO: Revise the discussion so that Richard gets laid off at Dover Consulting before this. I initially wrote this thinking it would happen before what is now chapter 2. His license has not yet been suspended. -->

*April 4, 2024 — Columbus, Ohio, United States - Rusty Bucket restaurant and bar*

"Welcome to Rusty Bucket, boys. My name is Cynthia and I'll be taking care of y'all this evening. What would you like to start off drinking?" The waitress turned and looked at Yuri. 

"Can I start with a Bud Light?"

"Sure, sweetie. What about you, hon'?" Cynthia then turned to Eaton. 

"Do you have Blue Moon?"

"No, but we have Shock Top. It's also a pale ale."

"That's fine, I'll take a Shock Top, thanks."

The waitress then turned to Richard, who was preoccupied playing Crypt of the Necrodancer on his phone. "Do you want anything to drink, hon?"

Richard didn't budge. After several seconds, Yuri knocked on Richard's head.

"Hey Dick, she's talking to you."

Richard looked up from his phone. "Oh shit." He turned to look at the waitress. "Can I get a Shock Top as well please?"

"Sounds good, I'll be right back with your drinks, fellass." The waitress walked off to a nearby table.

"What are you all up in your head about now, Dick?"

"Dude, they fucking suspended my license because I didn't pay a ticket I didn't receive! Thank God this fuckin' place is half a mile from my house."

"These fucking globalists love to slap us around, huh," Eaton groaned.

Richard looked for a second at Yuri and Eaton. They have been going out together to different bars around town to chill and drink almost every Thursday evening for the past three years, ever since they became friends when working together at Volvo. Richard had left about nine months prior for the small dev shop where he works, but he continued to hang out with Yuri and Eaton as they continued their positions at Volvo.

These guys were his compadres, his bois, his homies. 

"Yeah they fuckin' do. Maybe I should try to go back to remote work and get a little bungalow in Las Tarrenas, fuck this stupid ass place."

"You're just bullshittin'." Yuri had to chime in with his opinion. "You've been saying that since you left Volvo. You could do it tomorrow if you wanted, Dickman, and you know it."

Curiously, CNBC was airing on the TV in front of the gang's table. A newscaster was interviewing some guy from some company called MicroStrategy about Bitcoin.

"Bitcoin is at least digital gold. It's gonna eat gold. It's got all of the great attributes of gold and none of the defects of gold..." the interviewee droned on like this.

Yuri groaned again. "You know, I bought some Bitcoin at like $250 in 2013 when I was in college. It fuckin' dropped to $140 a month later so I punked out and sold. But what if I had hung onto it? I had like ten Bitcoins. That's like seven hundred G's now! Motherfucker."

Richard re-opened the game on his phone while Eaton put his hand on Yuri's shoulder. "It's for the best, bud. Bitcoin is like Zion from The Matrix —- it's just a trap for the slightly smarter NPCs." He eased back as he spotted the waitress walking briskly towards the table with the trio's drinks. 

"Here are your drinks, boys." Richard once again snapped out of his gaming stupor when he noticed the aroma of hops at the table. 

"The globalists are gonna take over Bitcoin like they took over the internet and our government. Yeah the number goes up, so what? Fiat money is worthless anyway, it all goes to zero. Just buy guns, ammo, and precious metals so that when the Happening happens and you can't access your Bitcoin without internet, you're not completely fucked."

Yuri slumped in his seat. "I guess I'm just gonna have to work until I die like everyone else."

Richard simply sat and listened. *Clearly motherfuckers are still making lots of money in crypto, otherwise they'd have just stopped talking about it forever ago, right?*
