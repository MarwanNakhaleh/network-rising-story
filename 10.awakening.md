*Mike Ropini invites Richard out to Dallas to discuss more network ideas and "collaborate". Richard interprets this as Mike offering him a job so he gets his ass on that plane and heads to Dallas. They end up talking about revolutionary ideas for several hours during this chapter.*

***Author's note:** I think I'm going to write several iterations of this conversation depending on how far into these ideas the reader legitimately wants to read. I can have a short version that fits a similar length to some of these chapters, then I can expand much further and maybe even provide the real-life links to some of the research items Mike provides to Richard at the end of their conversation.*

"You've seen it yourself. The bank can shut off your access to your money at any time. The insurance companies can refuse to pay for life-saving medical intervention because they can. The government can demand anything they want from you whenever they want, because who the fuck are you going to complain to?"

"You needlessly kill yourself slowly with all this junk food, all these convenience machines, all these microplastics. The FDA and every alphabet agency supposedly responsible for the well-being of the American people is a complete failure. There's no reason the world needs to be like this."

"Some people in this space do not care so much about which biological substrates composes intelligence and life. But I believe it is our destiny as humans to reach the top of the universe! And we'll build technology to the limits of what's physically possible to manifest this destiny."

Richard looked at Mike quizically. "Yeah, but what if we accidentally create ASI and it just fucking takes over everything and subsumes humanity? Then our biological substrate will be subbing for them, if you know what I'm saying."

"We can fight AI with AI. Remember, I am a biomedical engineer by trade. I'm very closely connected with scientists working on tools that provide add-ons to the neural capcity of the human brain, effectively expanding the limits of our conceptual frameworks. In other words, as AI gets smarter, we get smarter too with it! Remember, in Networkia, our exploration is not inhibited by the Fucking Dickhead Administration or any of their ilk."

"So you're saying this is the future no matter what?"

"Pretty much, unless the Happening happens." <!-- The Happening refers not to the poorly-received 2008 thriller film, but to a theoretical complete breakdown of modern society, whether through a single cataclysmic event or a series of degradations and failures in the global economic and communication network. Its definition was popularized on 4chan. -->
