***Work in progress***

*Richard goes to attend [ETHDenver](https://www.ethdenver.com)'s hackathon event. He builds an app that rewards people tokens for completing fitness challenges. His demonstration captures the interest of Mike Ropini, CEO of Networkia. Mike is very interested in human longevity, so he's inquiring about anyone in the hackathon building anything to do with health and fitness. Mike is impressed with what Richard was able to build by himself over the hackathon duration, but the two really build rapport after Richard shares his vitriol for the health insurance industry and they discuss their shared distaste for the establishment*
