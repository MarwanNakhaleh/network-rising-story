## Protagonist: your main character, and the primary driver of narrative events.
Richard Cabeza is 28 years old. He is 5'11" and at the beginning of the story he weighs about 190 pounds with a skinnyfat figure, but he loses weight and becomes healthier later on. Richard is American born with Dominican heritage. Richard has slick black hair, he's clean shaven, and he usually wears sunglasses. He dresses very casually most of the time but he will dress very nicely for events and parties. He starts the story living in Columbus, Ohio but he moves around the world throughout. He starts the story working as a front-end web developer at small consulting shop. He's relatively inexperienced in his career at about 4 years in the industry. He's a total nerd most of the time but he becomes a socialite when he drinks enough mamajuana. He also curses like a sailor.

He used to work with his friends Yuri and Eaton at Volvo until he left to go a small slow-paced consulting shop. He started his career at Volvo with high ambition to work his way up the corporate ladder, but seeing how pointless corporate life is and how everyone was treated made him feel jaded and disillusioned with the corporate ladder, so he left. His ambition is rekindled when he starts learning about blockchain and cryptocurrency after a series of unfortunate events instigated arbitrarily by different pillars of the establishment that leave him destitute.

### Supporting characters (maybe they'll have their own stories, who knows)
* Yuri Nader is 29 years old. He is the only child of a German man and a Russian woman who met in New York while working at the same convenience store. He works as a back-end web developer at Volvo. He was on Richard's team working on the same application at Volvo. They became friends when they realized they have the same fucked up sense of humor. Yuri had a rough and isolated upbringing, so he's a bit of a cynic and his humor is a little pointed. He also harbors regrets about buying Bitcoin at $250 in 2013 and then selling at a loss.

* Eaton Beaver is 31 years old. He is a conspiracy theorist. He did not work on the same team as Richard and Yuri, but he befriended them after he noticed Richard making a subtle 4chan reference in a department presentation. He is a big proponent of nationalism and anti-globalism. He comes from a redneck background, but he has the sense to treat people as individuals, even if they come from groups of people he doesn't like. 

Richard, Yuri, and Eaton became friends while they all worked at Volvo before Richard left. Yuri and Eaton are less ambitious than Richard was at Volvo, but Richard stopped with the ambition for some time. They go out every Tuesday night to different bars in the Columbus area and occasionally they go on weekend trips to Michigan to smoke a shit ton of weed. 

*Author's note: I just realized I might accidentally be setting up Eaton and Yuri to be wasted potential. I feel like I wanna write them in to join Richard in his network state ambitions after he realizes some success, because they too have sharp pain points with the establishment but they don't have the courage to join a fledgling organization, hence why they stayed at Volvo. We'll see about this*

## Antagonists: an opposing force who stands in the way of your protagonist achieving success.
* Jacob Achter — CEO of Achter-Volgen Bank, he hates the ethos of decentralization and cryptocurrency but he'll gladly use those things to make money and he secretly owns like ten thousand Bitcoins. The guy who became Satoshi was Jacob's college roommate and he never cleaned up after himself, so that's why he hates Bitcoin and blockchain in general. 

* Ronald Thump — the president of the United States. His highly technical advisor Yi Long Ma alerts him to the threat that wealthy decentralized anti-establishment entities pose to the current worls order, so Thump orders the director of the FBI Christofer Gay to send their best subversion operative to fuck up Richard's grassroots movement.
<!-- Antoine Gonzalez — the secretary general of the United Nations. We'll make him the ultimate bad guy advocating for the nation states to crush Richard's network state -->

* 

## Confidante: someone who provides counsel and guidance during times of trouble; they are often privy to information that is unknown by others within the story.
* Vi Braeter — the gender-nonbinary FBI operative sent to fuck with Richard's shit but it turns out they are actually receptive to his movement. 

## Anti-villain: someone who possesses qualities that make them morally ambiguous or questionable; they may seem like a good person, but over time their true motives and intentions are leaked.
* Mike Ropini — founder of Networkia. His parents died relatively young, so he wants to build a jurisdiction in which he's free to explore the limits of life longevity without answering to an regulatory entity. He adheres to the e/acc ideology but is more interested than anything in preventing biological death. Some of his justifications include expanding the scope of life and allowing people to recover from past mistakes and all. He has to actually make sense. 

## Foil: someone who serves to highlight the qualities of your protagonist by possessing opposite or contrasting traits. This character serves to aid or subvert the protagonist's aims.
* The Dragon King — A British Chinese guy actually named Long Wang who's Mike's CTO. The opposite of Mike in every way.  A technical wizard who takes Richard under his wing.

## Love Interest: a character who serves as the protagonist's goal or the reward they receive at the end of the story.
* Bella Ende — a traveler girl that Richard stumbles upon in Europe. She comes from Germany but she left because she's sick of all the migrants fucking up the German way of life. She starts off as a nationalist but becomes more of a futurist after meeting Richard.
