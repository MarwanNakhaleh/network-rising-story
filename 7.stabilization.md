*After losing most of the little bit of money he had left, he accidentally strikes it big with a 5000x on a $25 investment in one memecoin. This then inspires him to start studying smart contract development, and he builds his skills as a Web3 developer. Richard adopts the ENS name "0xdickhead.eth" as his crypto handle.*

*June 21, 2024 â€” Dublin, Ohio, United States - Richard's apartment*

# 7. Stabilization

The unforgiving heat of the sun beat down on Richard Cabeza's third floor apartment. The weather outside was hot as balls, but Richard was running out of money for discretionary spending like air conditioning. He sat at his battle station wearing nothing but his Spongebob boxers and reviewing emails he sent to recruiters, engineering managers, and employed developers without receiving replies. 

Richard took his right hand off of the mouse to adjust his nuts briefly, then he reached for the tall freezing cold glass of mamajuana to the right to his monitor. At this point, he wasn't drinking in order to be drunk or even to enjoy the alcohol. It was his primary source of calories since he [aped](## "to \"ape\" means to unthinkingly buy a dubious digital investment") most of his food money into memecoins. Closer to the center of the desk in front of the monitor rested Richard's second to last joint from the last boys' trip to Ann Arbor. His security deposit was already more than gone between the smoke and the crack in the wall, but at this point, he simply could no longer bring himself to give a shit.
