## 1. Betrayal
*February 20, 2024 — Columbus, Ohio, United States - somewhere on Interstate 670 westbound*

"Here are my license and registration. Can I help you, officer?" 

Richard Cabeza extended his right arm towards the passenger's side window of his beat-up rusty red 2009 Chevy Impala, his left hand tightly gripping the steering wheel. The police officer stood in silence looking at Richard, accepting Richard's documents. He looked somewhat menacing, but no more so than required for his work. As soon as the police officer took a hold of Richard's papers, Richard immediately brought his right hand back to the steering wheel. There was no need for him to put his hand anywhere else.

The air was still cool, but there were very few clouds in the sky, and the salt from the snow cleanup had been washed away by some strong rain the previous week. Really, it was a lovely day for February in Columbus, other than the *God damn fucking police officer pulling me over!*

"Do you know how fast you were going?"

"No I don't."

"You really don't have any idea of how fast."

"I dunno, fifty five miles an hour?" The speed limit where Richard had to stop was fifty five miles an hour.

*What a load of bullshit. Violence and crime are up, don't these pricks have more important things to do than pull people over for going a little fast? There weren't even any construction workers out! Just fuckin' revenue gathering bullshit.*

"I clocked you going seventy four miles an hour." The officer turned around the radar gun the speedometer to show Richard what he saw. "Where are you headed?"

"Home."

"Where's that?"

"My address is up to date on my license and registration."

"Is that in Columbus?"

*You have it right in front of your God damn face, you motherfucker.*

"Dublin."

The singular word hung still in the air while Richard and the police officer stared at each other. 

After what felt like an hour, a gust of wind blew past the officer, seemingly blowing away the conversation. 

The police officer finally broke the antagonizing silence, not losing sight of Richard as he kept his hands glued to the steering wheel.

"Stay right here, I'll be back." The officer started back to his vehicle to process Richard's information.

Richard retrieved his phone to send a message a group chat on Signal with his two close friends Yuri Nader and Eaton Beaver.

```
Gentlemen, just in case anything happens, I've been pulled over on 70 supposedly for speeding.
```

<div style="text-align: left"><b>Eaton</b></div>

```
Relax, buddy. You're not acting like a thug, right? He's just gonna give you your ticket and move on unless you chimp out on him.
```

<div style="text-align: right"><b>Richard</b></div>

```
You never know with these motherfuckers, especially with my name and appearance.
```

```
Man, you speak perfect English and you're almost as pale as I am. Your name is fucking Richard. You're just up in your head over it.
```

After a few minutes, the police officer arrived at the passenger's side window with Richard's driver's license and vehicle registration. As he accepted his documents, Richard immediately noticed the officer's hands were empty otherwise.

"Today is your lucky day," the officer started brusquely. "My printer couldn't print your ticket, so I can't hand it to you. You're free to go. Slow down and drive safely."

*Thank fucking God. That's what you get when you blow my tax dollars on fancy equipment and kickbacks instead of maintaining your fucking shit.* "Thank you, officer," Richard uttered softly. 

The officer started back to his vehicle. Richard watched him get back into the passenger's seat while his companion turned off the flashing lights and started to drive off, leaving Richard to merge back onto the road and continue his commute home.

The remaining twenty minutes of Richard's commute home from the small software consulting shop were very uneventful. Curiously, Richard chose to drive in silence instead of blaring old merengue music from his mostly-working speakers, despite his good luck. Finally, shortly before six o'clock in the evening, Richard arrived at his apartment complex. He maintained his calm demeanor as he ascended the stairs to the third floor of his building and walked towards his unit.

Finally, Richard arrived at his door. He quietly unlocked the deadbolt, opened the door, walked into the foyer, and closed and locked the door softly behind him.

Richard screamed sharply. "What a load of God damn bullshit!" He chucked his already cracked iPhone SE across the apartment and hit the drab empty white living room wall, making a crack in the drywall in the shape of the phone. *Fuck, there goes my security deposit.* "A waste of taxpayer money! There are more important things for these people to do! What the actual fucking fuck!" 

With a sigh of exasperation, Richard put down his backpack at the entrance of the apartment and started walking towards the kitchen, anticipating the nice tall glass of mamajuana that would calm his nerves and allow him to temporarily forget his confrontation with the police officer.

*October 27, 2010 — Cabral, Barahona, Dominican Republic - Uncle Diego's house*

Throughout his childhood and teenage years, Richard went with his family to the Dominican Republic a few times to visit and hang out with relatives. When he was fourteen years old, his crazy uncle Diego from Cabral poured him a shot of mamajuana from a flask and told him to drink it. Richard had never drank alcohol before then.

Two minutes after the fermented rum, wine, and honey slid down his esophagus, Richard started to notice a powerful warmth coursing through his veins. His body relaxed and his mind softened as the alcohol started to take effect on his body. After a minute or so of this newfound sensation, Richard walked out of the kitchen and proceeded to plop down on Uncle Diego's big comfy black leather couch. He gradually allowed the alcohol overtake his soul as he sank into the soft cushions and daydreamed of 1990s merengue music.

The mamajuana not only provided Richard with a temporary euphoria, the substance also left a permanent mark in his mind. The next day, Richard asked Uncle Diego for his mamajuana recipe. Ever since that day, Richard started practicing the art and science of making powerful and tasty mamajuana whenever he had an opportunity to do so.

*February 20, 2024 — Dublin, Ohio, United States - Richard's kitchen*

Richard sat at his otherwise empty kitchen table with his cold glass of homemade mamajuana, poured from a large pitcher sitting in his fridge that he prepared a month prior. Five additional pitchers of mamajuana continued to chill in the fridge, each one with its assembly date written in Sharpie. Richard sighed again as he stared into the inviting mixture in his glass. With a stone expression, he finally picked up the glass and took a sip of the sweet and fiery concoction. 

The drab look on Richard's face instantly vanished as soon as the mamajuana hit his lips. Even after many years of making and drinking mamajuana, every first sip he takes still sings to his heart and soul and melts the stress and worries away, at least for a few moments.
