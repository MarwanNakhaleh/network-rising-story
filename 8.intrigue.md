*With a couple of Web3 projects under his belt, Richard gains the confidence to attend [ETHDenver](https://www.ethdenver.com)'s hackathon event. He builds an app that rewards people tokens for completing fitness challenges. His demonstration captures the interest of Mike Ropini, CEO of Networkia. Mike is very interested in human longevity, so he's inquiring about anyone in the hackathon building anything to do with health and fitness. Mike is impressed with what Richard was able to build by himself over the hackathon duration, but the two really build rapport after Richard shares his vitriol for the health insurance industry and they discuss their shared distaste for the establishment.*

"I can empathize. My name is Michael Ropini, so make of that what you will."

Richard thought for a moment and smiled very briefly to himself. "I get it, man."
